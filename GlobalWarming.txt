Hello Everyone!

The temperature of the earth is increasing at a substantial rate because of various human activities.
This has lead to the problem of global warming and ozone layer depletion.


The adversities reflect the danger that we are going to head towards.
Some of the affects are:

Melting of the glaciers and thereby increasing the sea-water level, due to which the small island and countries can submerge.
Drastic climatic changes.
Frequent forestfires, landslides and cyclones.
Non-seasonal and erratic rainfall/ snowfall.
Extinction of endangered species of plants and animals. 

Its time to take some steps to save our Mother Earth or else it will be too late.

Thank You.
