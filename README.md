Hey there!

It's really difficult to follow the git and github tutorials.
The tutorials tend to be simple while going through it but when you get your hands dirty with the commands its really difficult it find the errors that you make. 
Thus, debugging is also a talent that people should have within them or try inculcating it by shear hardwork.

Hope these statements make sense to you!

Thank you.
